CS2QML - Adobe Creative Suite to Nokia QML
==========================================

Scripts for exporting things from different Adobe Creative Suite programs to Nokia Qt Quick prototypes.

* Adobe Creative Suite http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite.html
* Nokia Qt http://qt.nokia.com/

How come?
---------

Pretty often desingers tend to work with tools like Photoshop, Illustrator, After Effects and other similar software while creating User Interfaces and User Interactions.

Most of the time these would more properly communicated via working prototype that behaves like the final product. This is where QML comes along.

The scripts collected to this repository are to be used in this work flow.

Current status
--------------

The following scripts, Javascript with jsx extension, are available:

* After Effects - transitions
* Photoshop (from http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/photoshop-qmlexporter, where no changes since 16th Dec 2010)

It would be nice to have the following:

* Illustrator
* Flash Catalyst
* InDesign
